# Introduction

The Codewars API is organized around REST. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use
HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs.
JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.
